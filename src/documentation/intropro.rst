Introduction to The Project
***************************

This project duplicates an early research conducted by Szpiro (1986) :cite:`szpiro1986measuring`. The research aims to use the property/liability data of the U.S. during 1955-1975 to provide an evidence for constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) and estimate them with premiums and claims data respectively. We also use the aggregate insurance data of the U.S. during 1995-2015 to test if the CRRA assumption can still remains.

This documentation records a series of modules I constructed for the project.
